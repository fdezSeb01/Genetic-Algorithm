# Genetic-Algorithm
A genetica algorithm implemented in C# using Visual Studio IDE to predict the growth of the amount of CO2 in the atmoshpere. Given a CSV with previous years data and knowing the growth behaves as an incline cosine equation, the algorithm finds the most optimal coefficient to approach the given data. I then also provides a graph to visualiza the prediction and the given points.
